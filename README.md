CODSOFT Java Development Internship

Task Overview:
TASK 1: ATM INTERFACE
Create an ATM simulation with two classes: one for the ATM machine and one for the user's bank account. The ATM class should include methods for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance, and should interact with the bank account class to manage the account balance. Design a user interface to handle these options, validate user input, and display appropriate messages for successful or failed transactions.

TASK 2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
Collect marks for each subject, calculate the total and average percentage, and assign a grade based on this percentage. Display the total marks, average percentage, and the assigned grade.

TASK 3: NUMBER GAME
Generate a random number within a range (1 to 100) and ask the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. Limit the number of attempts, offer multiple rounds, and track the user's score based on attempts or rounds won.
